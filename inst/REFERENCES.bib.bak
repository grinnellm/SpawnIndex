  abstract    = {Herring stock abundance in British Columbia waters is assessed using an age structured assessment model for the major stock assessment regions and an escapement model for the minor stocks in Areas 2W and 27. These models have been applied to assess herring abundance since 1984. Accurate estimates of current and future stock abundance rely heavily on consistent and reliable biological sampling of the populations. Extensive SCUBA surveys are conducted throughout the British Columbia coast to enumerate the numbers of fish spawning in each area and this information forms an important part of the data for determining total abundance in the age-structured model. Additional data on total harvest, fish size and age structure of the spawning runs are used to determine current abundance levels. As in recent assessments a fixed spawn conversion or catchability factor is applied for the dive survey era beginning in 1988 and a free fitted parameter is estimated for the earlier surface survey period. In addition, a year specific logistic function is applied to model the availability of fish on the spawning grounds. Forecasts of future stock abundance are developed from estimates of historical recruitment and used to provide advice on allowable harvest. The harvesting policy permits a maximum of up to 20% removal of the forecast spawning biomass provided the abundance is greater than the fishing threshold or Cutoff level established to conserve biomass in periods of reduced productivity.},

  abstract = {The history of Pacific herring egg deposition surveys in British Columbia is reviewed. Variability in components of the SCUBA egg deposition survey methodology used to assess the spawning biomass of herring stocks was evaluated by bootstrap simulations, thus providing confidence interval estimates for mean egg density, total area of deposition, and spawning-stock biomass. Variability in estimated spawning-stock biomass was larger than expected from variation in egg density alone. Bias was evident in the mean egg density estimated by a visual assessment model, apparently due to inter-diver variation in estimating model variables. Optimal sampling designs are robust and remain within current capabilities for sample collection. Alternative sampling approaches should be investigated to improve the accuracy of egg density and consequently spawning biomass estimates. Egg loss from spawning beds during the incubation period appears to be significant and may bias abundance estimates if assessment surveys occur late in the incubation period, Additional investigation will be required to develop coastwide adjustment factors. Aspects of the variability associated with surface spawn surveys are also discussed briefly.},

In the early years of spawn surveys, adjacent spawnings were often reported as single events. Gradually, this practice has changed so that each spawning has a separate record. As a consequence of this change in methods, the mean length of spawnings has decreased in recent years but the total numbers of records has increased. Estimates of mean spawning width and intensity have also changed, partly due to changing survey methods as well as changing spawning distributions. A spawn abundance index is developed to account for these temporal changes. Abiotic factors affecting the distribution and abundance of spawn deposition include sea surface temperatures and the fishery. Biological factors affecting spawn distribution and abundance are not as well defined, but it is shown that in some situations, spawn dimensions may change as a function of stock abundance.},

Fecundity decreased as the fish ripened. Concurrently, ovary weight and egg weight increased and somatic weight decreased. Length-specific fecundities of fed and unfed fish were similar, but the unfed fish had higher weight-specific fecundities, corresponding to a greater loss of somatic tissue during impoundment. Feeding accelerated the rate of maturity, and fed fish spawned earlier with heavier eggs than unfed fish. Relative fecundity (eggs per gram) was highest among the unfed fish. Reduction in preovulatory egg number probably was a consequence of follicular atresia (observed but not quantified here). Age-, length-, and weight-specific fecundity of impounded herring varied within the range observed for naturally maturing populations (1974 and 1980). Fecundity in impounded fish varied no more than observed in nature: there was a greater difference in age-, length-, and weight-specific fecundity between years than there was between experimental treatments. We suggest that reduction in the number of maturing oocytes occurs naturally and reflects a mechanism that allows herring to adjust their egg size and egg number according to energetic resources and environmental conditions.},

To do EBFM, one of the key tools will be to use ecosystem models. To fully use ecosystem models and have their outputs adopted, there is an increasingly recognized need to address uncertainty associated with such modeling activities. Here we characterize uncertainty as applied to ecosystem models into six major factors, including: natural variability; observation error; inadequate communication among scientists, decision-makers and stakeholders; the structural complexity of the model(s) used; outcome uncertainty; and unclear management objectives. We then describe best practices to address each of these uncertainties as they particularly apply to ecosystem models being used in a LMR management context. We also present case studies to highlight examples of how these best practices have been implemented. Although we acknowledge that this work was compiled by ecosystem modelers in an LMR management context primarily for other ecosystem modelers, the principles and practices described herein are also germane for managers, stakeholders and other natural resource management communities. We conclude by emphasizing not only the need to address uncertainty in ecosystem models, but also the feasibility and benefits of doing so.},

  abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) involves using simulation to compare the relative effectiveness for achieving management objectives of different combinations of data collection schemes, methods of analysis and subsequent processes leading to management actions. MSE can be used to identify a ‘best’ management strategy among a set of candidate strategies, or to determine how well an existing strategy performs. The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE. This paper explores how MSEs are conducted and characterizes current ‘best practice’ guidelines, while also indicating whether and how these best practices were applied to two case-studies: the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus; Balaenidae) and the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax caerulea; Clupeidae).},

  abstract  = {Pacific herring (Clupea harengus pallasi) are winter–spring spawners which exhibit a south to north latitudinal dine in spawning time. In the eastern Pacific, major spawning populations are concentrated near San Francisco, in Puget Sound, and along the coasts of British Columbia and southeastern Alaska. In the Bering Sea, herring spawn in Alaska and along the Kamchatka Peninsula. In the western Pacific, herring spawn in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Japan Sea. Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus harengus) consist of both winter–spring and summer–autumn spawning groups characterized in the northeast Atlantic by oceanic, shelf, and coastal populations. The oceanic group are large migratory fish spawning off the coasts of Norway and Iceland. The shelf group includes the various locally migratory North Sea populations adjacent to the British Isles. The coastal groups consist of smaller fish restricted to the Baltic and White seas. In the northwest Atlantic, spawning occurs from northern Labrador to Virginia with spring spawners predominating in the north and fall spawners in the south. Herring typically congregate near their spawning grounds for several weeks to months prior to spawning. Temperature is one of the factors that determine when spawning occurs. The Atlantic herring exhibits sexual dimorphism in the spawning act with only the female interacting with the spawning substrate. Both sexes of the Pacific herring make physical contact with the substrate on which the adhesive eggs are deposited. Spawning grounds are located in high-energy environments, either nearshore for spring spawners or in tidally active areas for fall spawners. Spawn is deposited on marine vegetation or on bottom substrate, such as gravel, which is free from silting. The eggs are tolerant to temperatures in the range of 5–14 °C and salinities in the range of 3–33‰. Egg mortality results mostly from suffocation due to high egg densities and silting, predation, and, in intertidal spawn, from stresses imposed by exposure to air and from egg loss by wave action.},

No significant sampling biases were evident in the temporal trends of length and width of spawning areas or mean number of egg layers. However, a bias due to the underestimation by officers of the width of spawning areas was evident and an adjustment was derived from spawning areas surveyed by both groups. Egg density data from scuba surveys were used to convert officer estimates of the number of egg layers to estimates of total egg deposition. The adjusted area of deposition was combined with egg density estimates to determine total egg deposition for each spawning area surveyed in the time series. Estimates of spawning-stock sizes were substantially lower than had been estimated previously from these data. Stock trends and absolute stock sizes were similar to those obtained by other stock assessment techniques that rely primarily on age-structure information.},

Inconsistent results from the two areas surveyed during 1981 prevented general conclusions, but a corroborating resurvey of one area in 1983 suggested that a sampling intensity of five samples per 100 m of transect and transects every 250–400 m along the length of the spawn should result in estimates of the mean egg density with a standard error no greater than 25%. Systematic sampling is logistically preferable to random sampling and can be incorporated into the two-stage design described herein which should be used in future spawn surveys designed to estimate spawning escapement.},

  abstract  = {Spawning stock biomass of Pacific herring Clupea harengus pallasi can be accurately assessed by scuba surveys of egg deposition based on either a two- or three-stage subsampling design. A prediction model is incorporated to estimate the egg density in individual sample quadrats along transects set across the spawning beds. Two models are presented that estimate egg density almost equally well. Both rely on an estimate of the average number of egg layers on the vegetation, the type of predominant vegetation, the size of the sampling quadrat, and either an estimate of the proportion of the quadrat covered by vegetation (visual model) or a measure of the wet weight of the vegetation and attached eggs (biomass model). The biomass model is more accurate, but requires more labor-intensive, time-consuming sampling than does the visual model. Estimates of the optimal sampling designs for the two models reflect this and indicate that the biomass model should be used when very accurate estimates of stock abundance are desired, whereas the visual model is applicable when a rapid and efficient means of estimating stock size is needed and less accuracy is acceptable. A sampling intensity of 3 transects/km with a minimum of 4 samples/ 100 m of transect length should result in estimates of the mean egg density with a standard error no larger than 25% of the true mean. Optimal sampling fractions for a three-stage subsampling design indicate that from 1 to 12 spawning beds, representing from 10 to 100% of the total egg deposition in each statistical area, should be routinely surveyed.},

  abstract    = {The review of the herring stock assessment document by the PSARC Herring Subcommittee at the 1992 meeting identified an inconsistency in the abundance indices used by the two current assessment methodologies, i.e. the escapement and age-structured models. While the escapement model attempts to provide an absolute estimate of total egg deposition for each assessment region, this estimate was not being used in the age-structured model. Instead, the age-structured model used a relative index which is the sum of the total lengths of spawn adjusted by area specific but time independent estimates of average width and average intensity. The review also identified the need to re-evaluate the conversion equations used in the escapement model to calibrate surface survey observations of width and egg layers to diver widths and egg densities and suggested that this should include a consideration of the uncertainty associated with the escapement model estimate of total egg deposition. In order to deal with both of these concerns it seemed appropriate to develop a single estimate or index of egg deposition that combined all spawn data sources and presented the best estimate of total escapement. This index could then be used as auxiliary data in the age-structured model to estimate numbers at age and associated parameters. In the process of developing such a modified escapement model, an alternative index of egg deposition per unit length of beach or tonnage per kilometer was developed as one approach to estimating spawning stock biomass for small stocks outside the major assessment regions. The objectives of this document are therefore to describe and discuss several alternative spawn indices, their strengths and weaknesses, and aspects of the estimation of error structure for these data, with a recommendation of the preferred spawn index which may require additional refinements.},

  abstract  = {Data for 2937 fish, collected from seven locations over five years, were analysed to evaluate the effects of sea temperature and stock biomass on size-specific ovary weight and fecundity at spawning. Ovary weight did not vary significantly between years or locations. Size-specific fecundity was higher in 1983, when coastal waters were abnormally warm because of a strong El Niño – Southern Oscillation event. The effect of location was equivocal: one stock that overwintered in warm water tended to have a higher fecundity. Mean sea temperature between 60 and 90 d before spawning (in spring) best accounted for variations in size-specific fecundity. Temperature may influence fecundity by regulating gonadotropin concentration and consequently pre-ovulatory atresia. We hypothesize that the trade-off between fecundity and egg size is adaptive. A theoretical analysis of the early life history of Pacific herring suggests that, to maximize survival to metamorphosis, egg size should decrease and fecundity increase with temperature when the larval growth rate Q10 is less than the mortality rate Q10. Our model seems to explain the differences in egg size between recruit and repeat spawners, and between stocks of Atlantic herring that spawn in different seasons.},

Total volume of washed up material, consisting of eggs, vegetation and debris was estimated at 497 cu m, of which 68% by weight was herring spawn. The total estimated egg number was 5.76 x 10 to the 10th power, which was approximately 25% of the total egg deposition in the immediate vicinity of French Creek. Based on a conversion factor of 10 to the eighth power eggs per ton of fish, the egg loss represents the spawning capacity of about 576 tons of fish, which is not a substantial quantity when compared with the established stock in the Strait of Georgia. However, it is possible the deleterious effects of storms on spawn deposition may be widespread, but only noted in specific locations when phenomenal quantities are washed ashore.},

Investigations of spawn-on-kelp operations on the north coast and the Queen Charlotte Islands were carried out in 1982 and 1983. Herring mortalities were low during the capture, towing, and transfer of herring to impoundments; subsequent high mortalities appear to be the result of excessively high loading densities. Water quality in the impoundments remained high in spite of heavy egg coverage along the inside of the web. Depending on fish maturity and harvest methods, the quota for one licence (7.26 t of product) was estimated to require 28.6 to 63.5 t of hering. This does not consider the quantity of herring lost because of mortality before or after the fishery operations. Alternative harvest methods such as 'open ponds' have several advantages over the more traditional methods but are not suitable for all areas. An important factor limiting the spawn-an-kelp fishery is the availability of high quality kelp.},

With one exception each licence is permitted to harvest 16,000 pounds of SOK product and is allocated 100 tons of herring if operating an impoundment or 35 tons if they are using open ponding techniques. Operators primarily use closed ponding or impoundments to hold herring for a few to several days until they mature and spawn eggs on the giant kelp (Macrocystis integrifolia) suspended in the ponds. In a number of areas operators have been more successful using open pond techniques where kelp suspended from lines is either anchored in areas expected to attract spawning herring or frames are towed into areas of active spawning. Difficulty in estimating the tonnage of fish impounded, any resultant mortality in the ponds, and the long-term impact of disease on the population are ongoing issues in the precautionary management of this fishery as is the impact of the annual removal of large numbers of eggs on population productivity and viability.},

  abstract = {The energy supply available for growth and reproduction (surplus energy), fecundity, and egg size increase with female size in British Columbia stocks of Pacific herring (Clupea Aarengus pallasi). Fecundity is directly proportional to body weight, whereas egg weight is a curvilinear function with a weight exponent of about 0.2. The reproductive rate, defined as the product of fecundity and egg weight, is, therefore, proportional to the 1.2 power of the body weight. In 1974, 1978, and 1980 the size-dependent fecundity and reproductive rates were remarkably constant among management divisions along the coast. There is no evidence at present that these rates respond significantly to natural variations in stock abundance or marine climate. In contrast, there were interannual and regional differences in surplus energy that appeared as differences in the growth rate. Cluster analysis of the average length at ages 3-7 indicated that herring returning to the same division to spawn were more alike than those between divisions. An approximate reproductive value was calculated for the Queen Charlotte island stock from the foregoing information, assuming that the population was momentarily at equilibrium. For the suspected natural mortality rate (M = 0.45), the maximum reproductive value occurred quite late in the life span: between ages 9 and 10. In other stocks of Pacific and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus harengus), with adequate time series, the growth rates and hence weight-at-age have increased by as much as 50% in response to a combination of fishing and adverse environmental changes which reduced population size. Concurrently the age at first maturity fell by as much as 2yr. It is argued that the maximum growth response of a herring population roughly defines its ability to stabilize itself. If the maximum compensatory response is a 50% increase in weight at age, the population should be able to sustain an annual exploitation rate between 0.2 and 0.3. in principle, at this level of harvesting the population will be as resilient to a short run of unfavorable conditions as an unexploited stock.},

However, two underlying assumptions to this criterion remain to be tested: first, that a well-balanced age structure is indeed indicative of a “healthier” stock, and second, that managers can exert a control on the age structure, independently from the regulation of stock abundance. This study investigates these questions using simulations from a population model in which recruitment is based on egg production, which is more sensitive to age structure variations than the traditionally used spawning stock biomass (SSB) and that was parameterized to represent the population dynamics of North Sea cod, plaice, and herring. Our results show that (i) the age structure is highly dependent on the selection pattern, as well as on the level of fishing mortality; (ii) the selection pattern determines the ability of fish stocks to withstand, and recover from, external perturbation; and (iii) the selection pattern determines the output of the fishery providing the management option to balance stable but relatively low yields vs strongly fluctuating high yields. Therefore, we propose to make the selection pattern, for which clear management targets can be set, a policy goal instead of the age structure that is currently in place.},

This document describes how we calculate the spawn index from spawn survey observations (e.g., spawn extent, number of egg layers, substrate type). There are three types of spawn survey observations: (1) observations of spawn taken from the surface usually at low tide; (2) underwater observations of spawn on giant kelp, Macrocystis (Macrocystis spp.); and (3) underwater observations of spawn on other types of algae and the substrate, which we refer to as ‘understory.’ We calculate the spawn index in four steps. First, we develop a sampling protocol to estimate the number of eggs in a given area. Second, we develop a conversion factor to convert Pacific Herring eggs to biomass, which is critical to calculating the spawn index. Third, we calculate the spawn index for each of the three aforementioned spawn survey types: surface, Macrocystis, and understory. Finally, we combine the three spawn indices, and aggregate by stock assessment region and year to produce a relative index of combined sex spawning biomass. In addition, we identify uncertainties in spawn index calculations, and we describe how users can install the R package to calculate the spawn index using an example database. Although we transform the spawn survey data from egg density to biomass in tonnes, the annual time series of egg density and biomass are relative indices of spawning biomass.},

After fertilization and filling of the perivitelline space there was a decline in total egg volume in all salinities until 60–80 hr after fertilization. There followed a period of relative stability of total volume (100–240 hr), then a slow decline until hatching (240–618 hr). There was an inverse relation, between egg volume and salinity at all stages of egg development. Eggs transferred from 20‰ to 5 or 35‰ S, 87.4 hr after fertilization (90% blastodermal overgrowth of the yolk), showed only minor changes in total egg volume within the period of relative stability (100–240 hr). Prior to 80 hr, changes in egg volume appeared primarily to be simpleadjustments to prevailing osmotic and ionic conditions, modified, however, by presumed irreversible changes induced in the egg in relation to salinity experience at, and shortly after, fertilization. Subsequently, between 80–100 hr, egg volume appears to becomeregulated, commencing in the interval between late blastodermal overgrowth and blastopore closure. Yolk volume declined after fertilization, reached a minimum 40–60 hr after fertilization, increased to 100 hr, then decreased in the period of relative stability of total volume — presumably in relation to rapid growth of the embryo. In the latter period, yolk volume appeared resistant to change when eggs are transferred from 20 ‰ to 5 or 35 ‰ S, 87.4 hr, after fertilization. Volume of the perivitelline space reached a maximum after fertilization, then decreased until about 100 hr; between 100 and 240 hr it increased rapidly and was influenced only in a minor way by salinity changes in the incubation medium 87.4 hr after fertilization. Eggs exposed to cadmium in the interval between 1/2 and 30 hr after fertilization showed major reductions in total egg volume; total volume in the period of relative stability (100–240 hr) was much reduced and normal volume was not recovered after removal of such eggs to uncontaminated water at 30 hr.},
