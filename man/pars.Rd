\item{sok}{List with items:
\emph{nu} is the proportion of SOK product that is Macrocystis kelp
\insertCite{ShieldsEtal1985}{SpawnIndex},
\emph{upsilon} is the SOK product weight increase during a 24-hour brining
period as a proportion \insertCite{WhyteEnglar1977}{SpawnIndex}, and
\emph{w} is the average weight in kilograms of a fertilized egg
\insertCite{HayMiller1982}{SpawnIndex}.}
\item{surface}{List with items:
\emph{alpha} is the regression intercept
\insertCite{SchweigertEtal1997}{SpawnIndex}, and

\emph{gamma} is the regression exponent on egg layers
\insertCite{HaegeleSchweigert1990}{SpawnIndex},
\emph{delta} is the regression exponent on plant height
\insertCite{HaegeleSchweigert1990}{SpawnIndex}, and
\emph{epsilon} is the regression exponent on number of stalks per plant

\item{years}{List with items \insertCite{GrinnellEtal2022}{SpawnIndex}:
\emph{survey} is the first year of spawn survey data,
\emph{complete} is the first year of complete coastwide coverage,
\emph{assess} is the first year of spawn survey data that is reliable for
indexing purposes,
\emph{nine_cats} is the first year that spawn surveyors used nine
(instead of five) spawn intensity categories,
\emph{layers} is the first year that spawn surveyors estimated the number
of egg layers directly (instead of intensity categories), and
\emph{dive} is the first year of the dive survey period.}}

\description{
Parameters for Pacific Herring spawn index calculations: converting eggs to
biomass, spawn-on-kelp (SOK) calculations, as well as surface, Macrocystis,
and understory spawn index calculations. In addition, years in which there
were changes to the survey protocol and data.
