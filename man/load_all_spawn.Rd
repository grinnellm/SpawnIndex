\title{Load the all spawn table.}
\usage{
load_all_spawn(where, areas, years, ft2m = 0.3048, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{where}{List. Location and name of the Pacific Herring spawn survey
database, as well as required tables (see examples).}

\item{areas}{Tibble. Table of geographic information indicating the subset of
observations to include; from \code{\link{load_area_data}}.}

\item{years}{Numeric vector. Years(s) to include in the calculations. Message
if < \code{pars$years$assess}.}

\item{ft2m}{Numeric. Conversion factor for feet to metres; default is 0.3048.
Message if not 0.3048.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. Suppress messages; default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
Tibble. Contains additional spawn survey data including start and end
dates, as well as spawn length, width, and depth. Other information in this
tibble comes from \code{areas}: Region, Statistical Area, Section, and
Location code.
