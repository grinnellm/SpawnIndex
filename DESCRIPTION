Description: The SpawnIndex package provides data, parameters, and methods
    to calculate the spawn index for Pacific Herring (*Clupea pallasii*)
    in British Columbia, Canada. Spawn index calculations convert spawn
    survey observations (e.g., spatial extent, number of egg layers,
    substrate type) to the Pacific Herring spawn index, a relative index
    of spawning biomass. There are three types of spawn survey
    observations: surface observations, Macrocystis observations, and
    understory observations. In addition, the package includes methods to
    convert eggs to biomass and estimate spawning biomass in
    spawn-on-kelp operations.
