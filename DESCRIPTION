Description: The SpawnIndex package provides data, parameters, and methods to
    calculate the spawn index for Pacific Herring (*Clupea pallasii*) in British
    Columbia, Canada. Essentially, spawn index calculations convert spawn survey
    observations (e.g., spatial extent, number of egg layers, substrate type) to
    the Pacific Herring spawn index. There are three types of spawn survey
    observations: surface observations, Macrocystis observations, and understory
    observations. In addition, we include methods to convert eggs to biomass,
    and estimate spawning biomass in spawn-on-kelp operations. Note that the
    'spawn index' is a relative index of spawning biomass.
Note: 32-bit R is required to get data from the 32-bit MS Access database.
